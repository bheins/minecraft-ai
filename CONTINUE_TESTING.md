## Current Status: ✅ TEXTURE SYSTEM FIXED

The texture generation system has been successfully improved and is working correctly:

### Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ **Base64 parsing errors** - Now handles malformed AI responses gracefully
2. ✅ **Texture fallbacks** - Creates default colored textures when AI fails
3. ✅ **Directory creation** - Properly creates texture directories
4. ✅ **Error handling** - Comprehensive try-catch with meaningful logs

### Test Commands to Try:

Copy and paste these commands in Minecraft chat:

```
/aimod generate "ice sword that freezes enemies"
/aimod generate "golden pickaxe with fortune enchantment"
/aimod generate "healing potion that restores full health"
/aimod generate "fire boots that make you immune to lava"
/aimod generate "magic wand that teleports you"
```

### Recent Success:
- Generated textures stored in: `run\src\main\resources\assets\aimodgenerator\textures\item\`
- Files created: `default_generated.png`, `healing_sword.png`
- Persistence working: Content saved to `run\run\generated_content.json`
- AI integration stable: Ollama responding correctly

### Next Steps:
1. Test various item types (weapons, tools, armor, consumables)
2. Test block generation: `/aimod generate "glowing obsidian block"`
3. Verify recipe generation is working
4. Test the list and delete commands

### Known Limitation:
- Items require server restart to appear in game (Minecraft Forge registry limitation)
- This is expected behavior and documented

### Performance:
- Generation time: ~5 seconds per item
- AI model: llama3 via Ollama
- Fallback systems working correctly
