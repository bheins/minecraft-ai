## Usage Guide

### Available Commands

The mod provides several commands to generate and manage AI-created content:

#### **Generate Content**
```bash
# Generate an item (most common)
/aimod generate "magical sword that heals the player"
/aimod generate "fire staff that shoots fireballs"
/aimod generate "healing potion that restores full health"

/aimod delete unwanted_item
```

### Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Generate Content**
   ```
   /aimod generate "ice sword that freezes enemies"
   ```
   - AI creates item properties and texture
   - Content is saved to persistence file
   - Generation takes ~5 seconds

2. **Check What Was Created**
   ```
   /aimod list
   ```
   - Shows all generated items with descriptions
   - Each item has a unique ID (e.g., "ice_sword")

3. **Get the Item**
   ```
   /aimod give ice_sword
   ```
   - Item appears in your inventory immediately
   - Has custom name, description, and properties
   - Shows as a special item with AI-generated tooltip

4. **Use the Item**
   - Items appear as enchanted sticks with custom NBT data
   - **NEW: Right-click to activate special abilities!**
   - Hover to see AI-generated properties and usage instructions
   - **Teleport Wand**: Right-click to teleport forward (range and cooldown configurable)
   - **Healing Items**: Right-click to restore health when damaged
   - **Fire Staff**: Right-click to create fire blocks around you
   - **Ice Wand**: Right-click to freeze nearby water into ice
   - Properties include damage, durability, special effects

### Example Session

```bash
# Generate a few different items
/aimod generate "golden pickaxe with fortune enchantment"
/aimod generate "magic boots that let you walk on water"
/aimod generate "healing wand that restores health"

# See what was created
/aimod list

# Get the items you want
/aimod give golden_pickaxe
/aimod give magic_boots
/aimod give healing_wand

# Clean up unwanted items
/aimod delete magic_boots
```

### Running in Development
- Client: `./gradlew.bat runClient`
- Server: `./gradlew.bat runServer`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No generated content found" after creation:**
- Fixed in latest version - persistence system now working correctly
- Content loads automatically on startup

**"Registry is already frozen" errors:**
- This is expected behavior due to Minecraft Forge limitations
- Use `/aimod give <item_name>` to access generated items instead

**AI connection failures:**
- Check your AI service configuration in `aimodgenerator-common.toml`
- Ensure your chosen AI service is running (for local LLMs)
- Verify network connection and service URLs

### LM Studio Specific Issues
- **Won't start**: Make sure you have enough RAM (8GB+ recommended)
- **Connection fails**: Verify server is running on http://localhost:1234
- **Slow responses**: Try a smaller model or enable GPU acceleration
- **JSON parsing fails**: Switch to Llama 3.1 or CodeLlama models for better structured output

### Recommended Models

**Top 3 Models for LM Studio:**
1. **Llama 3.1 8B Instruct** (bartowski/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF)
   - Best overall performance for creative content generation
   - Excellent at understanding Minecraft context and generating JSON
   - ~8GB RAM required

2. **Mistral 7B Instruct v0.3** (microsoft/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3-GGUF)
   - Great balance of speed and quality
   - Good at following structured prompts
   - ~6GB RAM required

3. **CodeLlama 7B Instruct** (codellama/CodeLlama-7b-Instruct-hf-GGUF)
   - Excellent for generating structured data and properties
   - Very reliable for JSON output format
   - ~6GB RAM required

**Performance Tips:**
- **Fastest generation**: Use Mistral 7B with Q4_K_S quantization
- **Best quality**: Use Llama 3.1 8B with Q4_K_M quantization  
- **Most reliable JSON**: Use CodeLlama 7B Instruct
