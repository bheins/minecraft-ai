# Texture Generation Test

## Test Commands
After Minecraft loads, try these commands in chat:

1. **Basic item generation**:
   ```
   /aimod generate healing_sword "magical sword that heals the player"
   ```

2. **Test with different descriptions**:
   ```
   /aimod generate fire_staff "staff that shoots fireballs"
   /aimod generate ice_crystal "blue crystal that freezes enemies"
   /aimod generate golden_apple "apple made of pure gold"
   ```

3. **List generated items**:
   ```
   /aimod list
   ```

## Expected Behavior

### With Improved Texture System:
- ✅ No more "Illegal base64 character" errors
- ✅ Default colorful textures generated when AI can't provide images
- ✅ Graceful fallback handling
- ✅ Better error messages in logs

### Texture Generation Process:
1. AI attempts to generate texture (will likely fail with llama3)
2. System detects failure and creates default texture
3. Default texture uses item name hash for consistent colors
4. 16x16 colored square with black border
5. Texture saved to `src/main/resources/assets/aimodgenerator/textures/item/`

## Verification Steps:
1. Check that items generate without errors
2. Verify textures appear in-game (even if simple colored squares)
3. Check logs for improved error handling
4. Test persistence across game restarts
