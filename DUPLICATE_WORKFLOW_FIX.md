## Removed Duplicate Test Mod Functionality Workflow

### Issue
We had two nearly identical GitHub Actions workflow files for testing mod functionality:
- `test-functionality.yml` - Original workflow file
- `test-functionality-fixed.yml` - Enhanced version with additional tests

### Solution
1. Removed the outdated `test-functionality.yml` file (renamed to `test-functionality.yml.old`)
2. Renamed `test-functionality-fixed.yml` to `test-functionality.yml` to maintain workflow naming conventions
3. Updated the .github/README.md to reflect the correct workflow capabilities

### Benefits
- Eliminates confusion over which workflow file is active and correct
- Ensures that only one workflow will run when changes are pushed
- Maintains all enhanced testing features from the fixed version
- Keeps documentation in sync with the actual workflow implementation

### Verification
The new test workflow includes more comprehensive testing steps including:
- Build validation
- Unit tests
- Server startup tests
- JAR integrity verification
- AI integration tests (when selected)

This consolidation ensures that our CI/CD pipeline runs more efficiently and consistently.
